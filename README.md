# Password Generator

The password generator in this project is designed to allow users to generate a uniqe password between 8 and 128 characters. After clicking the green "Generate Password" button, users will choose whether they would like to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters in their password in a series of prompts. Each selection will be confirmed via prompt. At the end of the promps, the password will be displayed on the page, replacing the placeholder text "Your Secure Password".
